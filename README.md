daigo_org-theme-2013
====================

WordPress child theme for a wonderful Reverie, foundation 4 based template, 
beautifully created by Zhen Huang (http://themefortress.com/reverie/)

This child theme is created by Daigo Fujiwara
daigo@daigofujiwara.com
for my personal blog: daigo.org in August 2013.
I plan to be updating it.

While I am running unit tests and the theme appears to be working fine, but it is  the works.
You are free to use this theme. Hope you enjoy it.
If something is broken, you can let me know and I will try to fix it when I can, 
or feel free to get in touch via github -- issues, pull request

Shoutout to daigo.org/daigofujiwara.com or japaneseballplayers.com is appreciated but not required.

Both Reverie and Foundation are under MIT license, and so is this one.
